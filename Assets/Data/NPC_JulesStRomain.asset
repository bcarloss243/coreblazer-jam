  backstory: '"I still wake up at the hour when the greenhouse lamps flicker off
    their dew-drenched leaves. I like watching tight celery ribs unfurl like soft
    green scrolls as I sing little French folk songs to myself and I prune each stalk,
    believing a kind word made them sweeter. I tuck fresh parsley sprigs among the
    stalks so every pot carries a taste of home."'
  question: "What songs did I whisper to coax the celery\u2019s sweetness?  "
  answers:
  - French folk songs
  - Cajun lullabies
