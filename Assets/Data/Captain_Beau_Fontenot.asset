  backstory: "Beau once piloted spice-luggers up the Ivy and back, steering by memory
    when the fog rolled in. Nina\u2019s grandma supplied his galley; he still hums
    her gumbo shanty when tying up at dusk"
  memoryText: "\"When the river dozes, it doesn\u2019t sing, it hums. Watch the surface
    tilt ever so slightly as the stars rock it to sleep.\""
  question: "What songs did I whisper to coax the celery\u2019s sweetness?  "
  answers:
  - By the sway of its stars
  - By the sound of its foghorns
  - By the scent of its banks
