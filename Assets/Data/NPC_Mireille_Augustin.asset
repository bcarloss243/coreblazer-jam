  backstory: "Mireille Augustin is the one people call before the ambulance, before
    the priest. A healer, herbalist, and midwife, she keeps a parlor clinic behind
    her family home in Trem\xE9, where the curtains always shift and a pot is always
    steeping. She doesn\u2019t talk much, just listens, and somehow, you end up wanting
    to tell her everything.\n\nNina\u2019s grandmother once sent her here after a
    bad fever. Mireille broke the sweat with onion poultice and prayer, then made
    Nina stay until she could laugh again."
  memoryText: "\u201CYour grandmother brought you in with a fever, shaking like a
    leaf. I split an onion, pressed it warm to your soles, and told you stories \u2018til
    the color came back. That\u2019s what onions do, they draw things out, not just
    from the skin, but from the spirit.\u201D"
  question: "What songs did I whisper to coax the celery\u2019s sweetness?  "
