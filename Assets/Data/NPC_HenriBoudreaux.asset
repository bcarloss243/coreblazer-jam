  backstory: 'Henri Boudreaux has spent his whole life behind a stove: dishwasher
    at 13, line cook at 17, sous chef a few years after. Now, finally, he runs his
    own corner kitchen. Tin roof, handwritten menu, no substitutions. Locals say
    he seasons with memory, and that his roux never breaks. He''s got a quiet sadness
    about him.'
  memoryText: "I knew your grandmother, once. We worked Delphine\u2019s together,
    years ago. Her in the front, me in the back. I gave her a recipe once before
    she left the city, just scribbled on a napkin,  told her it was nothing, but
    it wasn\u2019t. Thought maybe she\u2019d remember me that way."
  question: "What\u2019s the soul of a good gumbo?"
  answers:
  - "he meat, if you\u2019ve got any"
  - The roux, dark as dusk
  - The person you thought about while making it, and who you get to share it with
